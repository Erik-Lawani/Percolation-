# Percolation-
This project estimates the percolation threshold using Monte Carlo simulation. It models a system with an N-by-N grid of open and blocked sites, where percolation occurs if a chain of open sites connects the top to the bottom row. The goal is to determine the probability of percolation based on varying site vacancy probabilities, p.
